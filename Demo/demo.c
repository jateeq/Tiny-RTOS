	The example was modified to remove the traditional UNIX approach of using
	shared memory get/attach since this was suddenly causing problems on eceunix.
	
	It has been modified to use the POSIX-style using functions mmap etc. to
	defined a memory mapped file which can then be used as a shared memory
	segment (between multiple processes) and accessed by standard C-type pointers.
	Basically, behaves exactly the same as the traditional UNIX shared memory.
